This example demonstrates a potential index out of bounds error in Ada.  The code iterates through an array and attempts to find an element greater than 5.  However, if no such element exists, the index variable will not be set to a valid value, leading to a runtime error when accessing the array at that index.  The solution demonstrates how to handle this case gracefully by adding a check to ensure the index is within the array bounds.
